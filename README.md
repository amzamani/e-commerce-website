Prerequisites : Nodejs must be installed to run the server. Mysql should be installed and running while node file is running.
Login in mysql is done through root and password is assumed to be ''(blank).If you want to change this you can change this from server/database/index.js

To initialise the server, the following commands should be typed on the cmd.

cd <location of file server.js>/e-commerce-website/server
node server.js

The site will be active on domain http://localhost:1212/

Admin feature for this site will soon be implemented.
